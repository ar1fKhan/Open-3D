## About this project

Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from the open-source community.

## Core features

* Basic 3D data structures
* Basic 3D data processing algorithms
* Scene reconstruction
* Surface alignment
* 3D visualization
* Python binding

## Supported compilers

* GCC 4.8 and later on Linux
* XCode 7.3 and later on OS X
* Visual Studio 2015 and later on Windows

## Who are we?
- Dec. 2014: `Open3D community` was established by `Ivan Malopinsky`
- Jul. 2015: `Open3D library` was initated by `Qianyi Zhou` and `Jaesik Park` from `Intel Visual Computing Lab`
- Jan. 2018: Zhou, Q., Park, J., & Koltun, V. published a preprint titled `Open3D: A modern library for 3D data processing.` (arXiv:1801.09847)
- Apr. 2018: `Hamdi Sahloul` restructured `Open3D library` and uploaded it to the `Open3D community` with different view and aims
  - Although `Intel Visual Computing Lab` team is currently active, they are more focused on implementing their algorithms to promote their own researches
  - On the other hand, our goal at `Open3D community` is to guarantee unbiased and rapid development of the `Open3D library`
- Since then, the Open3D community is maintaining a community version of the Open3D library
